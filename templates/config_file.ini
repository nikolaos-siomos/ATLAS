channel_subtype = 

#dead_time: The dead time of the photon counting channels (in ns). (for analog channels set _).

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Mandatory Variables for Licel
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#channel_id: IDs of each channel according to the raw file header. For licel provide the licel id per channel that is going to be include. Currently only BT and BC channels are supported. For PollyXT systems all channels are included by default. Provide only if you want to process specific channels
channel_id = 

#laser: The ascending laser number according to the licel manual. Use to link with the licel file. The channel_id is not a unique identifier for licel channels. A single channel can synchronize with more than one lasers. This variable is ignored when processing PollYXT files

#Mandatory Variables in the Future

#scc_id: IDs of each channel according to the SCC configuration. In the future, linking with the HOI will be done through the scc_id (currently optional).

#Partly Optional Variables

#These variables take default values. It is highly recommended though to fill them in because  might not be valid for the system.
#dead_time_correction_type: The type of dead time correction. Choose among:

#    • 1: Paralyzable
# Defaults to: 0 for photon channels.

#emitted_wavelength: The wavelength of the originally emitted laser beam per channel. A very rough guess process is applied by default using that detected channel information that it is valid ONLY for Nd:Yag lasers with elastic and vibrational Raman channels. Please provide the values explicitly if your system does not fall in this category. Defaults to:
#    • 355 for channels with detected wavelength <520nm
#    • 532 for channels with detected wavelength <1000nm

#If accurate molecular depolarization ratio calculations are required this variable should be filled in with the actual emitted wavelength with sub-nanometer accuracy.
emitted_wavelength = 

#detected_wavelength: The wavelength of the detected signal according to the applied Interference Filter of each channel (in nm). This variable is provided by default from the raw file metadata for both Licel and PollyXT. However, if accuracy is required for molecular calculations the exact central wavelength should be provided.
detected_wavelength =

#channel_bandwidth: Interference filter Bandwidth (in nm, Defaults to: 1nm). The default value is a very rough guess and it can easily lead to high uncertainty in the molecular depolarization value. Exact values provided from the manufacturers should be used instead.

#    • The 600th bin before the end of the profile if the trigger_delay_bins < 400

#Using default values is currently risky. Please make sure that no spikes are appearing in the pretrigger range that would affect the background correction or manually provide this variable.

#background_high_bin: ending bin of the background correction averaging range. Defaults to:
#    • The 100th bin before the end of the profile if the trigger_delay_bins < 400

#    • 1: linear
#    • 3: circular 
laser_polarization =

#laser_shots: The number of acquired laser shots per channel. Not recommended to provide it manually. If fetched from the metadata, this variable is different per file which is more accurate than providing a constant value here.

#analog_to_digital_resolution: The analog to digital resolution (in bits) of each analog channel. Use _ for photon channels.
